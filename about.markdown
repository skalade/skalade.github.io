    <h1>Hi there</h1>
    <p>My name is Sarunas, but I also go by Shawn. Iâ€™m a researcher specializing in Robotics and AI at AMD.</p>
    
    <p>I did my bachelor's and PhD in Electrical Engineering from the University of Strathclyde in Glasgow, Scotland, where I focused on applying machine learning to wireless communications.</p>

    <p>These days I'm particularly excited about robotics - in particular working on Vision Language Action (VLA) models and accelerating them in hardware like GPUs and NPUs. I also think LLMs for code generation are super cool - giving them tools like compilers and knowledge bases, then letting them optimize code autonomously is a really exciting research space.</p>
    
    <p>In my free time, I enjoy climbing trips with friends, hiking, fitness activities, and watching kdramas.</p>
