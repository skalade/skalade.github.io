    <h1>Hi there</h1>
    <p>My name is Sarunas, also go by Shawn. Work as a researcher at AMD.</p>
    
    <p>I did my bachelor's and PhD in Electrical Engineering from the University of Strathclyde in Glasgow, Scotland, where I focused on applying machine learning to wireless communications.</p>

    <p>These days I'm particularly interested in the prospects of Vision Language Action (VLA) models and accelerating them for real-time inference in GPUs, NPUs, FPGAs. Another big topic I focus on is LLMs for code generation - giving them tools like compilers, then letting them optimize code autonomously is a really exciting research space.</p>
    
    <p>In my free time, I enjoy climbing trips with friends, hiking, fitness activities, and watching kdramas.</p>
